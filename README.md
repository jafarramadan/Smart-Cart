# Smart Shopping Cart Application

## description 
The Smart Shopping Cart Application is a console-based program that simulates a shopping experience at a mall, where users can interact with different stores to add and remove items from their cart, view cart contents, and calculate the total cost of their purchases. The application includes a `Product` class to represent individual items, with properties such as Name, Price, and Category, categorized using an enum called `ProductCategory`. The `ShoppingCart` class manages the items added by the user, using a collection to store items and providing methods for adding, removing, and viewing items, as well as calculating the total cost. The `ProductGenerator` class is responsible for generating random products with varying attributes. Separate classes for different types of shops, such as `GroceryStore` and `ClothingStore`, allow users to browse and select items to add to their cart. The user interface provides a menu to shop at different stores, view the cart, and calculate the total cost, handling cases where users try to add or remove non-existent items, and looping continuously until the user chooses to check out and exit. Unit tests are implemented to ensure the correct functionality of adding and removing items from the cart and validating the total cost calculation.
